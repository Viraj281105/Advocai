# INDIAN LEGAL KNOWLEDGE BASE (IRDAI, CPA & OMBUDSMAN)

## 1. CLAIM SETTLEMENT & INTEREST (The "30 Day" Rule)
**IRDAI (Protection of Policyholders' Interests) Regulations, 2017 - Reg 15(10):**
- **Timeline:** An insurer must settle (pay) or reject a claim within **30 days** of receiving the last necessary document.
- **Investigation:** If the insurer needs to investigate (e.g., for fraud), they must complete it within 30 days. After that, they have 15 more days to pay. Max timeline = 45 days total.
- **Penalty:** If they miss this deadline, they MUST pay interest at **2% above the Bank Rate** from the date the claim papers were filed.
- *Agent Strategy: If the denial date > 30 days from submission, cite this regulation to demand interest.*

## 2. THE "MORATORIUM PERIOD" (Incontestable Clause)
**IRDAI Master Circular 2024 (Clause 4.2):**
- **Rule:** After **60 months (5 Years)** of continuous coverage, a policy becomes "Incontestable."
- **Impact:** The insurer CANNOT deny a claim citing "Non-Disclosure of Pre-Existing Disease" or "Misrepresentation" after 5 years, unless they prove active fraud.
- *Agent Strategy: If policy age > 5 years and denial is "You didn't tell us about diabetes," this denial is ILLEGAL.*

## 3. CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, 2019 (CPA)
**Section 2(42) - "Deficiency in Service":**
- Healthcare and Insurance are defined as a "Service."
- **Precedent (Supreme Court):** A wrongful denial of a valid claim amounts to "Deficiency in Service" and "Unfair Trade Practice."
- **Compensation:** Consumers can claim compensation for "Mental Agony" and "Harassment" in addition to the claim amount.

## 4. THE INSURANCE OMBUDSMAN (Grievance Redressal)
**Insurance Ombudsman Rules, 2017 (Rule 13 & 14):**
- **Jurisdiction:** Any grievance regarding (a) Partial/Total repudiation of claim, (b) Delay in settlement, (c) Dispute on premium.
- **Limit:** Up to **₹30 Lakhs** claim value.
- **Cost:** **₹0 (Free)**. No lawyer needed.
- **Binding Nature:** The Ombudsman's award is binding on the Insurer, but the customer can still go to court if they reject it.
- *Agent Strategy: Always end the appeal letter by threatening to "Escalate this to the Insurance Ombudsman under Rule 13."*

## 5. SPECIFIC MEDICAL PRECEDENTS (To Counter "Not Necessary" Denials)
**IRDAI Guidelines on Standardization of Exclusions (2019):**
- **Mental Illness:** Insurers CANNOT exclude treatment for Mental Illness, Stress, or Psychological disorders (must be covered equal to physical illness).
- **Modern Treatments:** Policies must cover: Robotic Surgery, Stem Cell Therapy, Oral Chemotherapy, and Immunotherapy (up to sub-limits).
- *Agent Strategy: If denied for "Robotic Surgery is experimental," cite the IRDAI Modern Treatment Guidelines.*

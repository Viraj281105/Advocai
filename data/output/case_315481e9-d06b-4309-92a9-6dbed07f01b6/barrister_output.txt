**Subject: APPEAL OF DENIAL – Genomic Sequencing for Early Cancer Detection – Policy Number: [Your Policy Number] – Claim Number: [Your Claim Number, if available] – Denial Code: CO-50**

Dear Appeals Committee,

This letter serves as a formal and urgent appeal of your decision dated [Date of Denial Letter], denying coverage for Genomic Sequencing for Early Cancer Detection, citing Denial Code CO-50. Your denial states that the procedure is "experimental, unproven, and therefore non-covered" under the terms of my Group Health Policy, referencing Section 4: Exclusions and Limitations. We respectfully but firmly dispute this determination and demand a full reversal of the denial, asserting that the requested procedure is medically appropriate and covered under the terms of my policy when properly interpreted.

### **SECTION I: Clinical Argument – Challenging the "Experimental" Designation**

Your denial hinges on the assertion that Genomic Sequencing for Early Cancer Detection in asymptomatic individuals is experimental and lacks sufficient peer-reviewed evidence of clinical efficacy, citing general positions from the American Medical Association and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. This broad generalization fails to account for several critical factors and misapplies the "experimental" exclusion to my specific clinical context.

1.  **Specificity of Clinical Context:** While general guidelines may express caution regarding widespread screening in *all* asymptomatic individuals, my physician's recommendation for genomic sequencing is not a blanket request. It is a targeted, preventive measure specifically indicated due to my significant family history of cancer, which elevates my individual risk profile beyond that of a general asymptomatic population. The insurer's denial does not demonstrate that genomic sequencing for early cancer detection in *individuals with a strong family history and elevated risk* is considered experimental or unproven by these same authoritative bodies. A nuanced understanding of clinical guidelines often supports tailored approaches for high-risk populations.

2.  **Evolving Medical Science and Standard of Care:** Genomic sequencing technology is not inherently experimental. It is a well-established and rapidly evolving field, increasingly integrated into various aspects of medical care, including risk assessment and personalized medicine. What may have been considered "experimental" a few years ago is now becoming standard practice for specific indications, particularly in the realm of proactive health management and prevention for high-risk individuals. The insurer's "comprehensive review of current medical literature" must reflect the most up-to-date understanding of genomic applications, not outdated perspectives.

3.  **Flawed Application of Policy Clause 4.2(b):** Your policy defines "experimental" if, inter alia, "Reliable evidence... does not demonstrate that the service or treatment is as safe and effective as standard treatments for the condition in question." The "condition in question" here is *early cancer detection in

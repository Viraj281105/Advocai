**SUBJECT: FORMAL APPEAL – DENIAL CODE CO-50 – Genomic Sequencing for Early Cancer Detection**

Dear Claims Review Department,

This letter constitutes a formal appeal of the denial of coverage for Genomic Sequencing for Early Cancer Detection, initially communicated with Denial Code CO-50. The stated reason for denial was: **"We determine that the requested procedure, Genomic Sequencing for Early Cancer Detection, is experimental, unproven, and therefore non-covered under the terms of your policy."**

We respectfully but firmly assert that this determination is erroneous, fails to consider the current landscape of medical science, and misapplies the terms of the policy. We urge a comprehensive re-evaluation and immediate reversal of this denial.

### I. Clinical Argument: The Evolving Standard of Care and Insufficient Basis for "Experimental" Classification

The insurer's blanket classification of Genomic Sequencing for Early Cancer Detection as "experimental, unproven" is a position that does not align with the rapid advancements and increasing clinical integration of genomic technologies. While specific clinical evidence was not provided for this appeal, the burden rests squarely with the insurer to provide robust, current, and specific peer-reviewed medical literature to substantiate its claim that this procedure, for its intended purpose of early cancer detection, remains experimental.

The landscape of genomic medicine is dynamic, with new applications moving from research to clinical utility at an unprecedented pace. Genomic sequencing, in various forms and for diverse indications, is increasingly recognized as a valuable tool in modern medicine, including oncology. To label an entire category of advanced diagnostic testing as "experimental" without specific, up-to-date evidence demonstrating its lack of safety, efficacy, or general acceptance for the *specific indication requested* is to disregard the current standard of care and the evolving body of medical knowledge.

The insurer's denial implies that Genomic Sequencing for Early Cancer Detection is still in early-phase clinical trials (Phase I, II, or III) or lacks demonstrated safety and efficacy compared to standard treatments. However, without presenting specific evidence to support this assertion for *this particular application*, the denial relies on a generalized and potentially outdated premise. The absence of specific, contrary evidence from the insurer, particularly in light of the rapid progress in this field, undermines the validity of their "experimental" classification.

We contend that the insurer has failed to meet its burden to demonstrate, with specific and current clinical evidence, that Genomic Sequencing for Early Cancer Detection, as prescribed, falls under the "experimental, investigative, or unproven" exclusion.

### II. Legal and Policy Argument: Misapplication of Exclusionary Language and Burden of Proof

The insurer's denial cites Policy Clause 4.2, which states:

**"4.2 Experimental, Investigative, and Unproven Services Coverage is limited to those services, treatments, and supplies that are medically necessary, provided they are not considered experimental, investigative, or unproven by generally accepted medical standards. For purposes of this Policy, a service, treatment, device, or supply shall be deemed experimental, investigative, or unproven if: (a) It has not received final approval from the appropriate governmental regulatory body, including but not limited to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for the specific indication or use for which it is prescribed or recommended; (b) Reliable evidence, as determined by the Company's medical review board and based on peer-reviewed medical literature, does not demonstrate that the service or treatment is as safe and effective as standard treatments for the condition in question; (c) It is the subject of ongoing Phase I

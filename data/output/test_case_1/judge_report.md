**Subject: Formal Appeal for Denial of Genomic Sequencing for Early Cancer Detection for [Patient Name], Policy ID: [Patient's Policy ID], Claim Number: [Claim Number], Date of Service: [Date of Service]**

Dear Appeals Department,

This letter serves as a formal and urgent appeal regarding the denial of coverage for Genomic Sequencing for Early Cancer Detection for our client, [Patient Name], under policy ID [Patient's Policy ID].'

### ISSUE-2
- **Severity:** medium
- **Sentence Index:** {'sentence_index': 2}
- **Description:** Partially supported claim: 'The insurer's stated reason for denial is: "We determine that the requested procedure, Genomic Sequencing for Early Cancer Detection, is experimental, unproven, and therefore non-covered under the terms of your policy." This determination cites the policy clause: "Coverage is limited to those services, treatments, and supplies that are medically necessary, provided they are not considered experimental, investigative, or unproven by generally accepted medical standards."

We unequivocally dispute this characterization.'. Missing: clinical evidence.
- **Suggested Fix:** Strengthen this claim by citing the missing evidence sources.
- **Evidence Refs:** ['The requested genomic sequencing was deemed experimental and therefore non-covered.', 'IRDAI Regulation 4.3', 'Policy Clause 4.2']
